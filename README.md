# EthicalHackingLabWork
A comprehensive collection of assignments and coursework for Ethical Hacking Concepts and Practices, covering key areas like Virtual Machine Setup, Reconnaissance, Host Discovery, Port Discovery, and Post Exploitation Techniques

This repository serves as a central hub for my coursework and assignments from the Ethical Hacking Concepts and Practices course. It includes a detailed exploration of various ethical hacking techniques, from initial setup and reconnaissance to advanced post-exploitation strategies.

## Assignments Overview

1. **Virtual Machine Setup**
   - Setting up multiple virtual environments using VMware for conducting safe and isolated hacking practices.
   
2. **Reconnaissance**
   - Detailed methods for gathering preliminary data and intelligence, crucial for planning effective security assessments.
   
3. **Host Discovery**
   - Techniques for identifying active machines on a network using tools like Nmap to uncover potential targets.
   
4. **Port Discovery**
   - Exploring various methods to identify open ports and services which can be potential entry points for attacks.
   
5. **Post Exploitation | RID Hijacking**
   - Advanced tactics to maintain access and elevate privileges within compromised systems, including RID hijacking techniques.

## Tools and Technologies

- **VMware Workstation**: For virtual machine management and isolation.
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and host detection.
- **Various Scripting Tools**: Utilized for automating the scanning processes and handling data.
- **Security Practices**: Implementation of various security measures to ensure ethical hacking guidelines are followed.
